# Launchlight · GitHub Pages Starter

This repository holds a small, single-page web experience built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to drop onto GitHub Pages without a build step.

## Running locally

Open `index.html` in your browser. No tooling or package install is required.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Commit the repo with `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` at the root.
2. In GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**. Choose the `main` branch and **/ (root)** folder.
4. Save. Your site will publish at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>` after a short delay.

## Customizing

- Edit text in `index.html` to match your project.
- Adjust colors or spacing in `styles.css`.
- Tweak the palette shuffler or idea prompts in `script.js`.
